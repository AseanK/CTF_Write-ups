- Under the `<script>` tag:
```<script>
	function send_request() {
		let val = document.getElementById("name").value;
		// ^p.....F!?
		fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`)
			.then(res => res.text())
			.then(res => {
				const res_json = JSON.parse(res);
				alert(res_json.flag)
				return false;
			})
		return false;
	}

</script>
```

- What we're interested in is the `// ^p.....F!?` comment

`^p` = Starting from p

`.` = Replaces any single charater

`F` = Ends with F

`!` = Symbols treated as regular character

`?` = Can replace anything
