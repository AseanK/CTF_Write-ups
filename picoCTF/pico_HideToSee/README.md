# Description
How about some hide and seek heh? Look at this image 'here'.


**tags: cryptography**

## Notes
- Contains `atbash.jpg` file
- Ran `exiftool atbash.jpg` to see the details about the file
```

Megapixels                      : 0.212
```

- Notice the `X Resolution: 1` and `Y Resolution: 1` sometimes when you use steganography, the X and Y resolution changes to 1

- Ran `steghide info atbash.jpg` 

```
"atbash.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 2.4 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase: 
  embedded file "encrypted.txt":
    size: 31.0 Byte
    encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
    compressed: yes
```

- This indicates there's a embedded `encrypted.txt` file
- Also It bypassed the passphrase, It usually asks to enter a passphrase, which means the password is just empty
- Ran `steghide extract -sf  atbash.jpg` to extract the data.

```
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "encrypted.txt".
```

- Left passphrase empty and extracted the file

- The txt file contains what looks to be a encrypted flag with atbash `krxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_92533667}` 
- atbash cypher is a simplistic cipher where you change A to Z, B to Y, C to X and so on
- Decrypted the flag using the online atbash converter

**Flag found: picoCTF{atbash_crack_92533667}**
